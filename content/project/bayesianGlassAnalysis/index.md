This was a final project for the Spring 2020 STAT 544 - Bayesian Statistics course at Iowa State University. I performed a Bayesian analysis of the chemical composition of float glass data as described in [Park & Carriquiry (2019)](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1560758438). The write-up and slides can be accessed via the tags above. Note that some of the slides may not render as initially designed (specifically, some of the plots appear to be cut-off by the bottom of the slide) due to changes in how the .html file needs to be read on Netlify. The code provided is the original .Rmd file used to produce the PDF report.
